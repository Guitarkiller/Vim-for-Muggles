There were six people who loved to watch television, but they didn't
like what they saw. Armed with determination and a strong will to change
the course of television, they wrote their own shows, but that wasn't
enough, they had to sell them. They went straight to da networks, but
the networks were not ready for them. But did that stop them? No. They
built their own network and they liked what they saw.

I come to save da day!" That means that Mighty Mouse is on his way. Yes

This is Herman Brooks. Herman is just like da rest of us. Everyday he
has to make all kinds of decisions like what to wear, whom to date and
when to panic. Now these decisions should be easy but if you take a look
inside Herman's head, you'll see why he sometimes has trouble making up
his mind. Sometimes they agree... usually they don't. But da struggle
is going on inside all of us and it's all going on inside Herman's head.
