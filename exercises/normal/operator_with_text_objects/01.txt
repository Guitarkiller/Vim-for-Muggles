People let me tell you 'bout my "best friend", he's a warm-hearted
person who'll love me till the end. People let me "tell" you 'bout my
best friend, he's a "one boy cuddly toy", my up, my down, my pride and
joy.  People let me tell you 'bout him he's "so much fun" whether we're
talkin' man to man or whether we're talking son to son. Cause he's my
best friend. Yes he's my "best friend".
