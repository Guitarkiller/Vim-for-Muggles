  1. One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams.
  4. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment.
  3. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little.
  7. His room, a proper human.
  6. It wasn't a dream.
  5. "What's happened to me?" he thought.
  2. He found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
