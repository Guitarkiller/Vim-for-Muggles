I bet we been together for a million years, And I bet we'll be together
for a million more. Oh, It's like I started breathing on the night we
kissed, and I can't remember what I ever did before. What would we do
baby, without us? What would we do baby, without us? And there ain't no
nothing we can't love each other through. What would we do baby, without
us? Sha la la la.

Dance your cares away, worry's for another day. Let the music play, down
at Fraggle Rock! Work you cares away, dancing's for another day. Let the
Fraggles play, We're Gobo, Mokey, Wembley, Boober, Red! Dance your cares
away, worry's for another day. Let the music play, down at Fraggle Rock!
Down at Fraggle Rock! Down at Fraggle Rock.
